Hello World!


How to configure a local cpp workspace.

nlopt: 
http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Installation#NLopt_with_C.2B.2B_algorithms
by default, nlopt is compiled into a static library, we usually want a shared library.

./configure --enable-shared --prefix=~/opt 

find_path cannot use $HOME variable


Let cmake compile and link with pthreads f you have CMake 3.1.0+, this becomes even easier:

set(THREADS_PREFER_PTHREAD_FLAG ON)
find_package(Threads REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_app Threads::Threads)
If you want to use one of the first two methods with CMake 3.1+, you will need set(THREADS_PREFER_PTHREAD_FLAG ON) there too.
