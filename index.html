Hello World!


How to configure a local cpp workspace.

nlopt: 
http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Installation#NLopt_with_C.2B.2B_algorithms
by default, nlopt is compiled into a static library, we usually want a shared library.

./configure --enable-shared --prefix=~/opt 

find_path cannot use $HOME variable
